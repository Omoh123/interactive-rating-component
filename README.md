## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was quite challenging especially with the javascript as this was my first project with javascript. Due to this challenge i was able to learn new things and commit alot of things to memory

```js
rates.forEach((rate) => {
    rate.addEventListener("click", () => {
 rating.innerHTML = rate.innerHTML;
    })
 });
```
### Continued development

selecting and changing elements with javascript
